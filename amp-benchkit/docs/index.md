# amp-benchkit Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **amp-benchkit**, a Python-based toolkit for automating amplifier bench measurements and providing a Qt GUI front-end for manual control.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Quickstart** instructions for cloning the repo, enabling fake hardware, and running the GUI or CLI workflows.
- **Hardware bring-up** notes for the FeelTech FY3200S generator, Tektronix TDS2024B scope, and LabJack U3-HV DAQâ€”including simulator fallbacks.
- **Developer workflow** guidance covering virtual environments, linting, and pytest usage.
- **Reference pages** for configuration environment variables, GUI layout, and testing expectations.

## Project Goals

1. Automate repeatable signal-generation and capture sequences across supported instruments.
2. Provide a cross-platform Qt GUI for manual smoke checks and lab workflows.
3. Offer simulator modes so contributors can test without physical hardware.
